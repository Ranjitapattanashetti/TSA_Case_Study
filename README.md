Tools: SAS Studio, Base SAS, PROC FREQ, PROC MEANS, ODS PDF

Analyzed 216,000+ TSA claims records (2002–2017) using SAS to identify trends, data quality issues, and state-level insights.

Cleaned and standardized raw data by handling missing values, duplicates, invalid categories, and date inconsistencies.

Created a date-validation logic to flag records with missing, invalid, or illogical dates (4,241 records identified for review).

Performed year-wise incident analysis to answer:
“How many claims occurred per year, and when did incidents fall below 10,000?”
→ Identified 2012 as the first year with <10,000 incidents.

Conducted state-level analysis using macro variables to dynamically answer questions such as:

Answered state-specific business question:
“In Hawaii, how many claims were related to Property Damage?”
→ 1,481 claims identified.

Generated a professional PDF report using ODS PDF, including frequency tables, plots, and formatted summaries for stakeholders.
